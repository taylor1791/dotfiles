# MacOS does not have a certificate bundle. Instead, they have a "Security
# Framework" accessible through Keychain. Despite this, I found
# /etc/ssl/cert.pem. It appears to be a certificate bundle. Additionally, it
# has a similar mtime to other system files.
#
# Teach nix the location of SSL CAs. See
# https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sec-nix-ssl-cert-file-with-nix-daemon-and-macos
